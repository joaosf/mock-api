# Build and deploy
Some utils commands:

- npm install -g firebase-tools
- firebase login
- firebase use --add
- cd functions; npm install; cd -
- firebase deploy
- firebase emulators:start (locally run)
- firebase login:ci (generate FIREBASE_TOKEN to put on github secrets)

But, everything what you need is done auto, build, deploy and other things.
